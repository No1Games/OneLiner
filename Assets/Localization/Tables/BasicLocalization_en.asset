      the word chosen by the leader. Other players do not know what word was chosen.
      The leader starts the game first and draws a line. After that, the turn passes
      to the next player in the list, who draws a line connected to the existing
      one. After each player's turn, the turn returns to the leader. The goal is
      to guess the word based on the drawing. The fewer turns, the more points the
      team earns. The number of turns is unlimited. Hearts can only be used to guess
      words."
